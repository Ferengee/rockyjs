# Rocky.js

Rocky.js is Pebble's framework for building watchfaces for Pebble smartwatches. As of [Pebble SDK 4.1](https://developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/08/15/introducing-rockyjs-watchfaces/), it can be used to create and publish watchfaces written in JavaScript!

Check out the [Rocky.js guides](https://developer.pebble.com/tutorials/js-watchface-tutorial/part1/) or [Rocky.js API reference](https://developer.pebble.com/docs/rockyjs/) if you want to learn more about developing with Rocky.js.

## Rocky.js Playground

This repository has now become the home of the [Rocky.js Playground](http://pebble.github.io/rockyjs/playground/) and the simulator library the Playground is built on. The Rocky.js Playground is an in-browser "scratchpad" for Rocky.js development, featuring simulated Pebble smartwatches to run the app as you develop it, all running locally in your browser:

## History

In April 2016, we shipped a firmware update for our smartwatches that included an embedded [JerryScript](https://github.com/pebble/jerryscript) engine, and a JavaScript implementation of TicToc, our default watchface.

A little later that year, in August 2016, we [shipped the first Pebble SDK with Rocky.js](https://developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/08/15/introducing-rockyjs-watchfaces/) support.

This repository also contains some of our previous explorations with JavaScript, in which we transpiled our smartwatch firmware to JavaScript, and ran virtual smartwatches in the browser. You can still find the [outdated examples](examples-legacy/) and [deprecated documentation](docs-legacy/) in this repository.
